                "content": "Liam, 10, was bursting with excitement. His family was leaving for Spain the next day, and he already had his posting plan ready.\n“First I’m going to put a countdown on my account,” he told his parents at dinner. “Then a selfie at the airport. Then one when we land!”\n\nHis mom put down her fork. “Liam, we need to talk about something before you do that.”\nShe explained that when you take a photo, your phone doesn’t just save the picture you can see. It also saves a hidden set of details about that picture — like a secret note tucked inside it. This hidden information, called metadata, can include the date, time, camera settings, and sometimes the exact location where the picture was taken.\n\n“That location information is called a geotag,” his dad added. “It comes from your phone’s GPS chip - like the one cars use for directions.”\n\nLiam looked puzzled. “But I never type in my location when I post.”\n\n“You don’t have to,” his mom said. “Most phones add it automatically unless you turn it off. Even if you don’t see the location on the screen, it’s still inside the photo file. If someone downloads it, they can read that data and figure out exactly where you were.”\n\nThe FBI warns that posting geotagged pictures while you’re away can tell strangers your home is empty. Posting lots of pictures from the same places - like your school or park - can also reveal your daily routine, something safety experts call a pattern of life.\n\nAfter hearing that, Liam decided to make a few changes:\n- Turn off location services for his camera\n- Check his privacy settings so only friends could see his posts\n- Wait until he was home to share his vacation photos\n\nIn Spain, Liam still took hundreds of pictures - sunsets, soccer stadiums, and giant churros - but kept them offline until he got back.\n\nA week later, he posted his “Spain photo dump.” His friends loved it, and his parents were happy he’d stayed safe.\n\n“I didn’t know my pictures had secrets inside them,” Liam said. “Now I make sure they don’t tell more than I want.”"
