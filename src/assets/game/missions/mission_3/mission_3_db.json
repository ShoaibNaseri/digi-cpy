That's exactly what happened to the Roberts family in Texas, and their story is like something out of a scary movie – except it was real. One night, Ellen and Nathan Roberts were sound asleep when a weird beeping noise jolted them awake. Then something terrifying happened: a man's voice started coming through their baby monitor. Ellen said the voice gave her chills. Nathan raced to the baby's room, heart pounding. But here's the weird part – no one was there. They quickly unplugged the baby monitor and their Wi-Fi and called the police. Later, they discovered the shocking truth: a hacker had broken into their baby monitor through the internet. You might be thinking, how is that even possible? Well, the Roberts were using a Bella baby monitor, which connects to Wi-Fi so parents can check on their baby using their phones. Pretty cool, right? But here's the catch – if you don't set it up safely, hackers can break into the device. The company, Bella, said this often happens when people use the same passwords they've used on other websites that have been hacked. And get this – the Roberts aren't alone. Other families have reported odd things happening with their baby monitors too. Some have seen their cameras moving by themselves, and in one case, a person claiming to be a \"security researcher\" started chatting with a family through their camera. Talk about creepy! The Roberts were lucky – the hacker just scared them, but because they turned it off right away, nothing else happened. But their story teaches us something super important: anything connected to the internet needs to be protected, whether it's a baby monitor, a security camera, or even a smart speaker. The best way to protect your devices is by using a strong and unique password."

But just like in real-life, doors need strong locks to stay safe. In this mission, you’ll learn how to build powerful passwords that protect your accounts — and what can happen if someone breaks in. That kind of break-in is called an account takeover, or ATO, and it can lead to stolen messages, changed settings, or even deleted progress in your favorite game. You’ll also discover four simple habits that help keep your passwords strong over time, how to stay safe when using shared or public devices, and why multi-factor authentication is like having an extra lock on your door. By the end of this mission, you’ll have the tools to guard your digital life — and stop others from getting into your accounts without permission. ",
