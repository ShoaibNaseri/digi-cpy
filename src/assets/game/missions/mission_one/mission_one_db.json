She was friendly, but different - and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, Charley wanted to find friends that shared her interests, so she went online to make friends, looking for people who liked the same music and hobbies she did. She created an Instagram page about her favorite band, and it felt good to be herself. Charley started meeting others online who shared her interests. For the first time, she felt seen and accepted.\nBut then kids from school found the page.Instead of cheering her on, they began mocking her — first with jokes, then with cruel comments. They teased her about how she looked, called her names like \"fat\" and \"ugly,\" and even told her to \"go die.\" Even people she didn't know — total strangers — began posting hurtful things.\nWhen one fake account got reported, the bullies made another. It felt never-ending.\n\nCharley couldn't escape it. At school, people whispered and laughed. At home, her phone lit up with mean messages. What used to be her safe space became a constant reminder of the things people said about her. She felt anxious all the time, checking her phone day and night to see what was being said. She felt embarrassed, angry, and completely alone.\nEventually, it started affecting her school life. Some of her friends stopped coming to school because they were being bullied too. Charley began skipping school and didn't want to go at all. She felt like no matter where she was, she was being watched, judged, and targeted.\nShe said what hurt the most was that many of the bullies acted nice in real life, but online, they became someone else. It made her feel like she couldn't trust anyone.\n\n Charley's story shows how real and harmful online bullying can be. It didn't just hurt her feelings... it affected her health, her learning, and her ability to feel safe anywhere.\nThis kind of bullying happens more than you think. In fact, 1 in 3 kids experience cyberbullying. That means it could be happening to someone in your class — or even to you.\nBut there's something you can do about it.\nIf you're being bullied online: It's not your fault. Tell a trusted adult right away. You do not have to face it alone.\nIf you see someone being bullied: Speak up. Report it. Show kindness. It could mean everything to that person.\nIf you're tempted to make fun of someone online: Pause. Ask yourself how you'd feel if it happened to you. Your words and actions matter, so be kind online and offline.\n",
