# **DIGIPALZ PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective Date:** October 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) sets forth the manner in which **Digipalz Corp.** (“Digipalz,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information obtained through our digital-safety education platform and related services, including the Digipalz website, dashboards, and Unity-based learning games (collectively, the “Services”).

Digipalz Corp. is a corporation organized under the laws of the **State of Delaware, United States**, with its principal office located at **3984, 1007 N Orange Street, 4th Floor, Wilmington, DE 19801**. All privacy inquiries should be directed to our **Privacy Officer, Samantha Tenus**, at [samantha@digipalz.io](mailto:samantha@digipalz.io).

This Policy applies to users located in the **United States** and **Canada**, and where applicable to users in the **European Union** and **United Kingdom** subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and substantially similar frameworks.

---

### **I. Commitment to Privacy and Compliance**

Digipalz is committed to lawful, transparent, and secure handling of all personal information entrusted to it. Our practices conform to, and are guided by, the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**, **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**, **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**, **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (including child provisions GDPR-K), **Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)**, and comparable provincial, territorial, and state statutes.

---

### **II. Information Collected**

**A. Information Provided Directly by Users**

Depending upon the user role, Digipalz may collect: names, dates of birth, classroom or school identifiers, regional location (state, province, territory, or country), parent or teacher contact information, billing information processed securely by Stripe, and such additional details as are reasonably required for account creation and administration. Children are not permitted to register accounts independently.

**B. Information Collected Automatically**

When a user interacts with the Services, Digipalz automatically records device and browser type, anonymized IP address and approximate location, session duration, page views, mission progress, and quiz performance. Cookies and analytics are employed to ensure functionality and service optimization; non-essential cookies are deployed only where regional law requires and consent has been obtained.

**C. Information Obtained from Third Parties**

Users may authenticate via Google or Facebook, which act as independent data controllers for login credentials. Digipalz also utilizes third-party processors including Stripe (for payments), Firebase and AWS (for hosting and infrastructure), EmailJS (for transactional communications), Google Analytics (for anonymized web analytics), Meta Pixel (for measurement on adult-facing pages only), and Chart.js (for internal data visualization). Each processor is contractually bound to use personal data solely for its designated function and to maintain appropriate safeguards.

No advertising, tracking plug-ins, or social-media widgets are embedded within the child learning environment.

---

### **III. Purposes of Processing**

Personal information is processed to operate, maintain, and improve the Services; create and manage accounts; authenticate users; deliver digital-safety lessons; furnish learning analytics to parents, teachers, and schools; process authorized payments; and comply with legal and regulatory obligations. Personal information is **not** used for behavioral advertising or automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects.

---

### **IV. Communications**

Digipalz communicates with:

- **Parents and Guardians** regarding account setup, progress reports, billing, renewals, and optional newsletters;
- **Teachers and Administrators** regarding onboarding, curriculum updates, feature releases, and optional professional newsletters; and
- **Students** through in-platform notifications limited to gameplay instructions and feedback.

Marketing communications are limited to parents and educators and include a clear means of opting out at any time.

---

### **V. Lawful Basis for Processing**

Processing is grounded in one or more lawful bases: (a) the consent of a parent, guardian, or institutional representative; (b) legitimate educational interest or contractual necessity when Digipalz acts as a processor for schools; and (c) legal obligation under privacy, education, or child-protection statutes.

---

### **VI. Parental and School Consent**

Accounts for minors may be created only by verified parents or guardians, or by educational institutions acting with lawful authority. Where permitted by law, a school board or district may provide consent on behalf of guardians pursuant to FERPA, PIPEDA, or equivalent legislation. All child data used for internal analytics is pseudonymized. Digipalz relies upon the representations and agreements of the consenting adult or institution and does not independently verify legal authority beyond reasonable documentation.

---

### **VII. Data Sharing and Cross-Border Transfers**

Personal information may be processed or stored in Canada (North America Northeast), the United States (us-central region), or the United Kingdom (europe-west region), depending upon the user’s location. Cross-border transfers are effected under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other recognized safeguards ensuring adequate protection of personal information. Digipalz does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information to advertisers, brokers, or unrelated third parties.

---

### **VIII. Data Security**

Digipalz employs administrative, technical, and physical safeguards commensurate with industry standards, including AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 encryption in transit, role-based access controls restricting identifiable child data to the Chief Executive Officer and Head of Technology, enforced Firestore security rules, and quarterly security audits. While these measures substantially reduce risk, no electronic system can be guaranteed to be entirely secure.

---

### **IX. Children’s Privacy and Safeguarding**

Children cannot self-register. All information relating to a child is obtained with verifiable parental or institutional consent. Digipalz does not host advertising, enable public profiles, or facilitate social interaction within its educational environment. Parents and schools may access, correct, or delete a child’s data at any time by using in-platform controls or contacting the Privacy Officer. Digipalz does not monitor or intercept student communications and encourages adults to report suspected online harm encountered outside the platform to appropriate authorities.

---

### **X. Data Retention and Deletion**

Personal information is retained only for as long as is reasonably necessary to deliver the Services or as required by law. Upon account deletion, all identifiable records are permanently and securely erased; limited anonymized data may remain for statistical or audit purposes. Requests for deletion may be submitted through account settings or by contacting [samantha@digipalz.io](mailto:samantha@digipalz.io).

---

### **XI. Individual Rights**

Subject to applicable law, users may request access to, correction of, or deletion of their personal information, withdraw consent, request data portability, or lodge a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority. Digipalz will respond to such requests in accordance with governing law.

---

### **XII. Governance and Accountability**

Digipalz maintains a comprehensive Privacy Management Program overseen by the Privacy Officer. The program includes regular Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), employee privacy training, vendor risk assessments and Data Processing Agreements (DPAs), and annual reviews to ensure continuing compliance with COPPA, PIPEDA, FERPA, GDPR, and CIPA.

---

### **XIII. Breach Notification**

Should a data breach involving personal information occur, Digipalz will notify affected users and, where applicable, regulators without undue delay, consistent with obligations under PIPEDA and GDPR Article 33.

---

### **XIV. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability**

The Services are provided on an **“as is” and “as available”** basis. Digipalz makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

1. Digipalz shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to this Policy or the use of the Services, even if advised of the possibility of such damages; and
2. **the aggregate liability of Digipalz for any and all claims relating to this Policy or the Services shall not exceed the greater of (i) one hundred U.S. dollars (US $100) or (ii) the total amount paid by the claimant to Digipalz for the Services during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.**

This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory of liability and survives termination of the Policy or any agreement between the parties. Nothing herein limits liability that cannot lawfully be excluded under applicable law.

Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their login credentials and for all activity under their accounts.

---

### **XV. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

This Policy and any dispute arising hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Delaware, United States**, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall reside in the state and federal courts located within Delaware.

---

### **XVI. Amendments, User Acknowledgment, and Contact Information**

Digipalz may revise this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated in advance via email or in-app notification; non-material changes take effect upon posting. Continued use of the Services after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.

**User Acknowledgment.** By creating an account, registering for, accessing, or otherwise using the Services, each user (1) acknowledges that they have read this Privacy Policy in its entirety; (2) understands and agrees to be bound by its terms; and (3) accepts sole responsibility for reviewing this Policy periodically to remain informed of any changes.
