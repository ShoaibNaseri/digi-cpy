    question:
      'What makes Digipalz different from other digital safety programs?',
    answer:
      "Most programs focus on rules — we focus on how kids actually think, feel, and respond online. Digipalz is based on true stories and reviewed by child safety experts, educators, and a psychotherapist to ensure it's age-appropriate and trauma-informed. Through gamified storytelling and real-world simulations, kids practice making safe choices that stick. We even mimic real social platforms so lessons carry over beyond school and home. Digipalz isn't just education — it's digital self-defense."
